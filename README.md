# 100-Year Website

A minimal, dependency-free static website designed to last a century without maintenance.  
All files are self-contained: no databases, no external fonts, no CDNs.

## ðŸ“˜ How This Works

- Every push to `main` auto-builds:
  - `.zip` archive (GitHub Release)
  - `.warc` web archive
  - SHA256 checksum file
- Archives are uploaded to:
  - GitHub Releases
  - Internet Archive (Wayback Machine)
  - IPFS (via web3.storage)
  - Arweave (permanent blockchain storage)

## ðŸ§­ Notes
- Replace `<your-username>` and `<repo-name>` above.  
- The `IPFS` and `Arweave` badges will update each time you push.  
- The `Last Archived` badge updates automatically in CI/CD.
